            <p  className='explanation'>&emsp;In today's world, we rely on technology for almost everything, from ordering food to finding our way around a new city. However, there is one aspect of our daily lives that has been largely overlooked: our bathroom habits. A bathroom app would be a useful tool to help us manage our daily bathroom needs. The app could help us find the nearest public restroom, provide information on the cleanliness of different facilities, and even offer suggestions for eco-friendly bathroom products. Additionally, a bathroom app could be a useful tool for people with medical conditions that require frequent bathroom trips, such as bladder or bowel disorders. With a bathroom app, we could feel more confident and comfortable when we're out and about, knowing that we have access to the information we need to take care of our bathroom needs.</p>
